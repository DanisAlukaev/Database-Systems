1. Using B-Tree index

	a. Improving the Query 1 (Q1).
	
		i. Targeted table and attributes:
		
			The index was created on table 'payment'. Specifically, it was created on the 'amount' column. This column is of numeric(5, 2) data type, where 5 is precision of the number
			and 2 is its scale. 
			
		ii. Data Definition Language (DDL) query:
			
			CREATE INDEX amount_payment_index ON payment USING btree (amount);
		
		iii. Analysis of cost before and after the creation of the index:
			
							Before index creation	After index creation	Improvement (absolute value)	Improvement (percentage)
			Estimated start-up cost	510.99			510.99			0.00				0.00
			Estimated total cost		12062691.37		11659130.21		403561.16			3.35
			 
	
	b. Improving the Query 2 (Q2).
	
		i. Targeted table and attributes:
		
			The index was created on table 'rental'. Specifically, it was created on the 'last_update' column. This column is of timestamp data type.
			
		ii. Data Definition Language (DDL) query:
			
			CREATE INDEX last_updated_rental_index ON rental USING btree (last_update);
		
		iii. Analysis of cost before and after the creation of the index:
			
							Before index creation	After index creation	Improvement (absolute value)	Improvement (percentage)
			Estimated start-up cost	534.78			535.06			-0.28				~ 0.00
			Estimated total cost		2284549.49		1557083.92		727465.57			31.84

	c. Improving the Query 3 (Q3).
	
		i. Targeted table and attributes:
		
			The first index was created on table 'film'. Specifically, it was created on the 'rental_duration' column. This column is of smallint data type.
			The second index was created on table 'film'. Specifically, it was created on the 'release_year' column. This column is of year data type.
			The third index was created on table 'address'. Specifically, it was created on the 'phone' column. This column is of varchar(20) data type.
			
			
		ii. Data Definition Language (DDL) query:
			
			CREATE INDEX rental_duration_film_index ON film USING btree (rental_duration);
			CREATE INDEX release_year_film_index ON film USING btree (release_year);
			CREATE INDEX phone_address_index ON address USING btree (phone);
			
		
		iii. Analysis of cost before and after the creation of the index:
			
							Before index creation	After index creation	Improvement (absolute value)	Improvement (percentage)
			Estimated start-up cost	7747.19		0.94			7746.25			~ 100.00
			Estimated total cost		7747.20		5392.39		2354.81			30.40

		iii. Analysis of cost before and after the creation of the index:
			
			

REQUIREMENTS:

i. Targeted table and attributes
	Describe where the index was created, and justification of why you choose them - this should include aspects like the datatype 
	of the column, common values, range, etc. (At least 70 characters) (2 scores)
ii. DDL query (2 scores)
iii. Cost before and after the creation of the index (1 score) 
Write the absolute values and the percentage of improvement.
